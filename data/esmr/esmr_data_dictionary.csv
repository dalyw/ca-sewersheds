• Effluent (EFF-001, EFF-002 for different outfalls, or EFF-001A, EFF-001B for different monitoring locations on the same outfall). Effluent monitoring locations must be related to discharge points. Discharge point 001 is associated with EFF-001A and EFF-001B,
etc.  

• Internal (INT-001, INT-002…)  

• Receiving Surface Water (RSW-001, RSW-002, etc.; optionally RSW-001U, RSW001D, RSW-002U, RSW-002D, etc. for upstream and downstream reference in a stream or river)

• Discharge to land (LND-001, LND-002…)
